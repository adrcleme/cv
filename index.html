        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I'm Adrien a passionate first-year Data Science Master student at EPFL. I am eager to explore data science's vast fields,
             focusing on machine learning and data analysis. I would love to contribute to meaningful projects
              where I can apply my skills. Here are some information about me :

                <h2>Academic Background</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
                    <B>2021</B> : General Baccalaureate (Maths/Physic Chemistry) - LIAD, Algiers <br>
                    <B>2024</B> : Bachelor Degree in Mechanical Engineering - EPFL (5.55/6 GPA)<br>
                    <B>2025</B> : 1st year Data Science Master - EPFL 
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
                    I come from a mechanical engineering background, where I learned a lot about problem-solving and thinking analytically. 
                    But I've always believed in testing things out to see what really sparks my interest. <br><br>
                    For me, data science and specifically machine learning just clicked. Even though my initial degree was in mechanical engineering, 
                    I've been diving into ML and have built up some experience in the field. <br><br>
                    Now, I'm excited to take it further and pursue data science, because it's something I genuinely want to do. 
                    I believe that anything is possible with the right approach, and I'm ready to keep learning and growing in this amazing field.</p>

            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <p class="exp-list">
                <B>Bachelor Project </B>: For my bachelor's project, I worked on a machine learning project focused on training 
                a <i>neural network</i> to teach an AI to play Pacman. 
                This was a great hands-on experience that really deepened my understanding of 
                neural networks and reinforced my interest in machine learning.
            </p>
            <p class="exp-list">
                <B>Swiss AI Initiative: </B>: I had the opportunity to work with the Swiss AI Initiative, 
                where I helped with <i>monitoring</i> and data visualization for their large language models (LLMs). 
                Additionally, I was involved in <i>data analysis</i> of their requests and contributed to creating user-friendly documentation 
                to make everything more accessible to users.

                    I'm genuinely motivated to dive into your project, and I believe my drive shows 
                    in the fact that I'm taking the time to create this simple website as part of my application.
                     It may not be something fancy, but it's a small proof of my passion and determination 
                     to take the next step in my journey. I'm fully committed to learning and contributing, 
                     and I'm excited about the opportunity to be part of your team.<br><br>

                    Additionally, I have a flexible schedule since I mostly work from home and don't go to my courses. 
                    This means I can easily adjust to meet deadlines, come to your lab if needed, or plan meetings. <br><br><br>
